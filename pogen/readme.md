# POGen

POGen is a Procedural Outline Generator. With it, you can run a local webserver that picks story subjects from lists of nouns, media, and themes. The user is prompted to imagine an outline from the selected subjects and write a short description and title in the form. The submitted writing gets saved to a textfile, and is served up as a page on the site.

## Build

```
go build main.go
```

## Run
run the generated executable, then point your web browser to `localhost:3333/index.html`
