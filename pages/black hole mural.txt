A mural of a giant blue star getting siphoned into a black hole. On the left side of the mural we see the star, fiery and active. In the middle is the black hole, radiating heat and light from its gas cloud. To the right of the black hole the mural indicates forming planets and stars, spun off from the jets of the massive object. We see even blue stars forming in the stellar nursery, hinting to a circle of life - type meaning.
